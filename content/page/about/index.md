### Intro
Hi I'm Zack, thanks for stopping by!

By day I am a self-taught Staff-level DevOps Engineer who has an extremely deep background in various computer systems and programming langauges. Tech has always been my passion in life, and I've been lucky enough to be able to turn that into a career.

When I'm not at work, I'm a maker who is passionate about combining the highly technical with the highly creative. From jury rigging servers together to figuring out what adhesive to use between two different types of plastic, I love to challenge myself, and want to keep growing as a creator.

My hope is that if you're reading this page, you're passionate about these things too. One of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal is our ability to learn from and teach one another, regardless of your skill level. I hope something you find here may be useful to one of your projects (tech or otherwise) - and if so, I'd love to hear about it!

### About this site
`zack.zip` serves as my public journal and blog of adventures in nerditude, and is brought to you by a server rack humming away in my garage - that's about as farm to table as it gets, baby!

### Give me a shout
I'm some variation of `@horvaticus` most places, so if you see me, feel free to reach out! I've got a link tree available on the [links page](https://zack.zip/links/). If you'd like to stalk me around the intenret feel free to check those out!

### FAQ
I get asked these from time to time:
#### Do you do commissions?
Not yet, I am still exploring how to best offer 3D printing and scanning services at this time.
#### Why do you upload to both Printables & MakerWorld?
Because I think it's lame when games get published to one storefront over the other, and feel the same about STL files. Creators get rewarded for total downloads and boosts for published models, but, it's more important to me that you have a choice in where you download your files from.
#### Do you own the license to the items you print?
In some cases yes, as these are purchased (with appropriate license), open sourced, or are original designs. In cases where I do not own the copyright (but am allowed to print or remix a model for personal use) I believe in making the best possible effort to give the original author a shout out! It's good digital karma.
