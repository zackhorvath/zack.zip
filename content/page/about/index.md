## Welcome to my garage!

I'm Zack, and it's a pleasure to have you here.

### About this site
`zack.zip` serves as my public journal and blog of adventures in nerditude, and is brought to you by a server rack humming away in my garage - that's about as farm to table as it gets, baby!

### Some background about me

By day I am a self-taught Staff-level DevOps Engineer who has an extremely deep background in various computer systems and programming langauges. Tech has always been my passion in life, and I've been lucky enough to be able to turn that into a career.

When I'm not at work, I'm a maker who is passionate about combining that highly technical part of my brain with the emerging creative side. From jury rigging servers together to figuring out what adhesive to use between two different types of plastic, I love to challenge myself, and want to keep growing as a creator and honing my craft.

My hope is that if you're reading this page, you're passionate about these things too. One of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal is our ability to learn from and teach one another, regardless of your skill level. I hope something you find here may be useful to one of your projects (tech or otherwise) - and if so, I'd love to hear about it!

Based in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, my home conventions are <b>Emerald City Comic Con</b> and <b>PAX West</b>.
