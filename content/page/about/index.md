### Intro
Hi I'm Zack, thanks for stopping by!

By day I am a self-taught Staff-level DevOps Engineer who has an extremely deep background in various computer systems and programming langauges. Tech has always been my passion in life, and I've been lucky enough to be able to turn that into a career.

When I'm not at work, I'm a maker who is passionate about combining the highly technical with the highly creative. From jury rigging servers together to figuring out what adhesive to use between two different types of plastic, I love to challenge myself, and want to keep growing as a creator.

My hope is that if you're reading this page, you're passionate about these things too. One of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal is our ability to learn from and teach one another, regardless of your skill level. I hope something you find here may be useful to one of your projects (tech or otherwise) - and if so, I'd love to hear about it!

### Frequently Asked FAQs
#### Do you do commissions?
Kinda? I am still exploring how to best offer 3D printing and scanning services at this time.
#### Printables or MakerWorld? Why do you post to both?
Because I think it's lame when games get published to one storefront over the other, and feel the same about STL files. Creators get rewarded for total downloads and boosts for published models, but, it's more important to me that you have a choice in where you download your files from.
#### How do you handle intellectual property and licensing with comissions?
I strictly follow the original license of any intellectual property I use in my costumes. In some cases, the designs are original, open sourced, or I have purchased a commercial license. In others, I am often using a community personal use license. I do not directly profit off of my props, I do it for fun, for me.

I believe in making the best possible effort to give the original author a shout out too! It's good digital karma and keeps the creative process spinning.
