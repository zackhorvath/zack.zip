# STALKER Gauss Rifle
This is nearly a 1:1 copy of the original Gauss Rifle from the STALKER trilogy, with a few modern modifications to make your life a little bit easier.

Using the Anomaly mesh files as reference, I painstakingly solidified the object to make it suitable for 3D printing. I then proceeded to make the following modifications:

- I adjusted the geometry of various parts of the prop to accommodate wooden dowels, these significantly increase the strength of the prop.
- I extended the handguard at the front of the receiver (where the magazine well is), so it now sits flush against the receiver. I added a classy little wing to it so it looks original, but having this part slot against the receiver will hide the dowel and also give you a flat surface to epoxy against.
- There are two versions of the receiver files and magazines - with and without magnets. I printed mine with magnets, however I ended up just epoxying the magazine so it was fixed in place. Your use case may differ.
- There is also a standard "10 round" magazine, and an extended "15" round magazine. I personally think the "15 round" magazine photographs better, but the "10 round" is a true copy.
- I included a Picatinny/Weaver rail file that can be installed to the top of the receiver, however I would recommend investing in a metal optic rail if you are going to use a real sight like I did.
- I opened the wire holes on the barrel to support 4.5mm OD wiring. I would not recommend going larger than this.

All in all, it went together fairly well after I worked out the kinks. The original model was in pretty rough shape, so some compromises were made in what could be printed, and what could be accomplished in post-processing.

Thanks for looking!

## Printing Instructions
### Recommended Filament / Settings
I highly recommend using PETG or PLA+.

I personally used black BambuLab PETG-HF at .16mm, 4 wall loops, and 15% gyroid infill.  

### Printing Order
Print all files with the following exceptions:
- Pick a version of Receiver_B.
- Select which magazine you would like.


## Assembly
See below for materials list. Approximate assembly order should be as follows (adjust to your workflow)

1) Attach Stock A to B w/ 3 dowels
2) Attach Trigger Group to Receiver A w/ 2 Trigger Group Dowels
3) Attach Receiver B to A to Stock w/ Main & Receiver Dowels
4) Begin assembling Barrel, connecting Barrel_A1 to Receiver_B. Insert Handguard Dowel between Barrel_A1 and Receiver_B, but do not permanently attach until done.
5) Begin stacking the barrel components. Barrel_A2 glues to Barrel_A1, B_1 to A_2, B_2 to B_1, etc.
6) Barrel_E2 is the end of the handguard, permanently affix handguard dowel at this point.
7) Finish build with Barrel_F1 and Barrel_F2.

I recommend using 2-Part epoxy instead of Super Glue since epoxy will have a little bit more "give", yielding a more functional prop. However, CA glue will work in a pinch.

### Materials
#### Required
Source the following wood dowels:

1/2" OD Wood Dowels:
- Main Dowel ~760mm
- Grip Dowel 1 ~40mm

1/4" OD Wood Dowels:
- Grip Dowel 2 ~40mm
- Handguard Dowel ~337mm
- Receiver Dowel ~250mm
- 3x Stock Dowel ~66mm

Lengths are approximate, and I recommend you double check dowel length before breaking the glue out. Sand dowels to fit depending on printer calibration or if you're in a part of the world that uses a normal measurement system. Press-fit is fine, but I'd recommend going looser so you can get more epoxy into the dowel holes.

#### Optional
* 4.5mm OD Black/Yellow wire for the practical wiring effect.
* 32x2mm Neodymium Magnets to taste
* A metal picatinny/weaver rail + appropriate screws
* Optic
* Sling loop if you want to attach a sling. Recommend screwing this into rear of receiver.
* Label maker for the magazine decals.

### Finishing the Prop
I am working on a blog post for this, though there is no "right" way to do it. Feel free to use mine as inspiration!

## Changelog

- **2024-09-06**: Initial Release

## TODO
- Finish remeshing the "original" SUSAT scope; there's a large floating section so I am having a hard time figuring out how to best deal with that in a practical and aesthetic manner.
