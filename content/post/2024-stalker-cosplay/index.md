## Intro
I had a blast making this costume; it wasn't the most technical project, but it was really fulfilling on a personal level and got to bring one of my characters to life.

This is my first "content" post, so I am not sure how to structure things moving forward, but I plan on doing individual posts about the props and their creation process, and then a post for how everything came together (which is this).

### What is "STALKER"?

> The name "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." is a backronym for Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers and Robbers.
Apart from a really bad hashtag, [STALKER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) is a first-person shooter survival horror RPG that was first released in 2007 for PC.

Basically, it's a game about being a post-apocalyptic treasure hunter in a radioative post-soviet wonderland. I ended up getting the game for my birthday circa 2007, and must have dumped a thousand hours into the STALKER trilogy through the following decade.

Fast forward to today, and I'm about to get my fix back on - STALKER 2 is almost here! After playing the demo at PAX West, I think it's safe to say that the wait will be worth it.

I also got to shoot with the GSC crew at the STALKER 2 booth!

My favorite part of this costume was putting the props together.
