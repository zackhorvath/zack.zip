# First!
Hey there,

This post serves as the quintessential "first!" post on any blog to make sure that the wiring is all glued together properly. I'm super excited to have a place to be able to write long-form content, such as guides and walkthroughs, that aren't appropriate for other platforms.

## Facts for Nerds
This blog was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a customized [Stack](https://stack.jimmycai.com/) theme; the beauty of this combination is that the entirity of this website is actually static! There's no databases, nor crazy hosting setups, and the best part is that it's all hosted on a GitHub wiki page that I've put a custom domain in front of. The future is pretty sweet, back in the day this would be "rent a hosting provider" affair but now the most expensive part of all of this is the domain fees per year... since a 4 character `.zip` domain is allegedly attractive.

I paired it with [FrontMatter](https://frontmatter.codes/) to give me a headless content management system that runs directly out of Visual Studio Code too.
